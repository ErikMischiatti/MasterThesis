# DETECTION Module

This directory contains the object detection module, designed to identify and locate specific objects in the environment through an image processing pipeline.

## Directory Contents

- **config/**: Configuration files for detection, including parameters such as thresholds and model paths.
- **models/**: Contains pre-trained models required for detection, typically in ONNX or similar format.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts to execute detection and manage data flow.
- **launch/**: ROS launch files that start detection nodes and load configurations.

Each subfolder is organized to separate and manage the files required for the functionality of the `DETECTION` module.
